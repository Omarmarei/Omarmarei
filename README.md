# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Omar, a passionate full-stack web developer specializing in Python, PHP, and JavaScript. I graduated as a mechanical engineer, but I've always had a deep love for computers and technology since my school days. Back then, I enjoyed rooting Android and using Linux Ubuntu instead of windows, and I've continued exploring various tools and technologies ever since.
