# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Omar, a tech enthusiast with a strong foundation in business development. Although my professional background is in mechanical equipment business development and sales, I've always been deeply passionate about technology. From my school days, where I enjoyed rooting Android devices and experimenting with Linux Ubuntu, I've constantly explored new tools and technologies. Over time, I've developed a keen interest in programming, particularly in full-stack web development with Python, PHP, and JavaScript.

Now, I'm eager to transition into a career that combines my expertise in business development with my acquired programming skills. I'm looking forward to roles like Technical Product Manager, Solutions Architect, or Business Development Engineer in Tech, where I can leverage both my business acumen and my passion for technology.
